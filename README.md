 Rural Digital Learning Platform

A Next-Gen Rural Digital Learning Platform designed for the hackathon problem statement:
"Next-Gen Rural Digital Learning Platform with Adaptive Edge AI and Community Simulation & Learning."

This project focuses on bridging the digital divide in rural areas by combining Adaptive Edge AI for personalized learning and Community Simulation for collaborative education. It supports children, elderly, and differently-abled learners, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility even in low-connectivity regions.

📝 Problem Statement

Rural areas often face challenges such as limited connectivity, lack of personalized learning tools, and low access to inclusive education. Traditional e-learning platforms fail to adapt to these constraints.

Objective:
To design a scalable, offline-first digital learning platform that leverages Adaptive Edge AI and Community Simulation & Learning to deliver personalized, collaborative, and inclusive education experiences.

🚀 Features

🤖 Adaptive Edge AI for real-time personalized learning

👥 Community Simulation to promote collaborative and peer-driven education

🎙 Voice and text-based interactions for accessibility in local languages

🌍 Inclusive platform optimized for rural and low-connectivity environments

🖥 Edge device integration (Raspberry Pi, ESP8266) for offline-first usage

🎮 Unreal Engine environments for immersive, simulation-based learning

🛠 Tech Stack

Edge AI Models (lightweight ML/NLP for adaptive learning)

Unreal Engine 5 (simulation & immersive learning environments)

Python (AI integration, edge computing)

Raspberry Pi OS customization (standalone rural learning nodes)

IoT devices (ESP8266, MPU6050) for interactive features

Convai API (for AI conversations, with future scope for custom LLM)
