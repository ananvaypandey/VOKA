# VOKA – AI Companion Device

## Overview

VOKA is an intelligent, human-centric AI companion designed to support elderly individuals, people with disabilities, and users requiring emotional or daily-life assistance. The system enables natural voice-based interaction, safety monitoring, and early detection of cognitive decline.

VOKA leverages conversational AI and voice synthesis to create a friendly and emotionally aware digital companion. The goal is to improve quality of life, reduce loneliness, and assist caregivers by providing early insights into behavioral and cognitive changes.

The project integrates ElevenLabs via Convai to deliver realistic speech output, making interactions feel natural, comforting, and human-like.

## Key Features

 AI Voice Companion – Natural, human-like conversations

Text-to-Speech (TTS) – High-quality voice output using ElevenLabs

Early Dementia Detection – Monitors speech patterns and response behavior

Emotional Support System – Designed to reduce loneliness and anxiety

Hands-Free Interaction – Fully voice-controlled experience

Assistive Technology – Built for elderly and differently-abled users

Real-Time Interaction – Fast and responsive conversational flow

## How It Works

The user speaks to VOKA using voice input

Speech is processed through Convai’s conversational AI pipeline

The AI understands intent and context

A response is generated using a generative AI model

ElevenLabs TTS converts the response into natural speech

Speech behavior and response patterns are analyzed to identify early cognitive changes

## Technologies Used

ElevenLabs API – Text-to-Speech (via Convai) API 

Convai SDK – Voice-based conversational AI

Python – Core application logic

Raspberry Pi / PC – Deployment hardware

Speech Recognition APIs

IoT Sensors (MPU6050, ESP8266) – Safety and monitoring

Generative AI Models – Conversation & reasoning
